Are you passionate about driving insights with data? Do you often ask yourself, if I just had these data, I could...? Do you sometimes imagine what our lives will look like three years from now in these times of the convergence of the AI and the bio revolutions? If the answer is “YES” to all the questions above and... you have an interest for applying Machine Learning/AI in the computational biology space – then we have an exciting opportunity for you. AstraZeneca is a company that always follows the science and turns ideas into life changing medicines. Oncology Data Science plays a unique role in driving drug discovery and translating basic science to clinical practice. We strive to improve the utilization of data to patients’ benefit by leading the adoption and development of computational/data driven approaches to all aspects of the drug discovery process. The Data Science and AI research team in oncology is composed of a diverse group of data scientists, algorithm developers and applied mathematicians working together with computational biologists, bioinformaticians, software engineers, biologists and oncologists to deliver the next drug, next biomarker and next insights to the benefit of cancer patients. Our group is pioneering new Data Science and AI methods and practices to drive drug discovery. As AI is playing a bigger role in our lives, data is becoming more abundant, more diverse and more complex. ML/AI methods and techniques are expending - we need more experts to drive our ground-breaking research to find the right drug, to the right patient at the right time. We are looking for truly skillful people with hands-on ability and clear thinking. People who are ambitious that are not afraid to try out stuff and fail, motivated to make an impact and pioneer new tech and science; a scientist to lead the research and development of new AI methods and practices to drive insights from high dimensional omics data. This is a rare opportunity to lead and develop new approaches combining computational biology and advanced AI, utilizing a breadth of omics data from biobanks and clinical studies to data generated using ex-vivo platforms.

The hospital is a designated Trauma Centre and tertiary referral centre for Neurological and Cardiac patients. The trust is also a teaching hospital with close links to the Peninsula Medical School and the University of Plymouth. Living and working in the South West offers a fantastic work life balance. Whether it's a BBQ on the beach, paddle boarding around the historic Drakes Island, or a cycle on the moors, you could be doing any of these things within 30 minutes of leaving work at University... Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust. The Role The main purpose of this post is to provide comprehensive statistical insight through interrogation of complex NHS datasets to identify trends and highlight areas of good practice as well as areas for improvement. You will use mathematical, statistical and operational research methodologies to model and analyse a wide range of NHS data. You will make recommendations based on your findings to improve existing operational and/or strategic business decisions. The role will offer the candidate the opportunity to familiarise themselves with a range of health systems and datasets, working closely with operational leads and clinical staff to inform operational processes. They will also gain experience with a variation of reporting and modelling tools. The role will involve a variety of tasks which could include:  Using data science methodologies and techniques effectively to model and analyse a range of healthcare information  Carry out complex analysis of complex patient flows using a variety of analytical methods and tools and be able to convey complex situations and analysis to a wide ranging audience  Create new predictive systems to improve forecasting and demand planning  Provide in depth analysis of performance issues, highlighting any variation and providing insight.  Assist in the development of data visualisation techniques to present analytical results  Use simulation modelling techniques for operational research work, using open source tools such as R Studio or Python  Ensure new models are regularly tested and validated to maintain accuracy  Ensure regular routine models are automated Location We are based in The Range Global Headquarters, a 10 minute walk away from the main hospital. It is encouraged as a new starter within the Information Analysis Team to come into the office when you can, as it will afford you greater exposure to the department, give you the opportunity to meet new people and network, and also to have face-to-face time with your manager and team. Initially, you should be able to attend The Range in person to ensure that you can be supported as a new starter and eventually take back home appropriate kit that will enable a successful home-workstation set-up. The Candidate We are seeking a highly motivated individual with a relevant degree (e.g. data science) who is quick and keen to learn, with a passion for using computer programming languages to perform deep-dive investigations, data analytics and modelling, providing evidence for strategic and operational decisions to benefit patient care. The successful candidate will role model our organisations values and behaviours by being Open, Respectful, Collaborative and Innovative. They will have exceptional attention to detail, promoting high standards in all that they do and be adaptable and flexible in meeting the challenges that healthcare data science entails. You must have the ability to work independently, taking responsibility for delivery of work within agreed timescales. Whilst team working is essential, in time you will come to be expected to work independently to develop solutions and seek out answers to problems using your own initiative. Previous experience working within Data Science is an advantage, likewise for previous domain knowledge of the NHS or healthcare, but neither are essential. Desirable Skills and Experience NHS Data knowledge is unlikely, but not a barrier for a candidate with the right aptitude for learning about this domain. Technical skills include R and Python, and also Excel and reporting delivery tools such as SSRS and PowerBI Knowledge of multiple modelling techniques including discrete event simulation, machine learning, forecasting and multivariate statistics Excellent communication skills, both written and verbal, including presenting complex information to large groups of staff The scope of systems we report from is large, therefore the ability to work as a team, present issues and solutions confidently, and take on board feedback, is essential to not becoming overwhelmed. Naturally, experience in working in an organisation with similar scope and pressures would be an advantage. Likewise, the demonstrable desire to work in such an organisation and develop at an exciting pace as a Data Scientist is equally desired.
