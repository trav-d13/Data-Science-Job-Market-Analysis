Are you passionate about driving insights with data? Do you often ask yourself, if I just had these data, I could...? Do you sometimes imagine what our lives will look like three years from now in these times of the convergence of the AI and the bio revolutions? If the answer is “YES” to all the questions above and... you have an interest for applying Machine Learning/AI in the computational biology space – then we have an exciting opportunity for you. AstraZeneca is a company that always follows the science and turns ideas into life changing medicines. Oncology Data Science plays a unique role in driving drug discovery and translating basic science to clinical practice. We strive to improve the utilization of data to patients’ benefit by leading the adoption and development of computational/data driven approaches to all aspects of the drug discovery process. The Data Science and AI research team in oncology is composed of a diverse group of data scientists, algorithm developers and applied mathematicians working together with computational biologists, bioinformaticians, software engineers, biologists and oncologists to deliver the next drug, next biomarker and next insights to the benefit of cancer patients. Our group is pioneering new Data Science and AI methods and practices to drive drug discovery. As AI is playing a bigger role in our lives, data is becoming more abundant, more diverse and more complex. ML/AI methods and techniques are expending - we need more experts to drive our ground-breaking research to find the right drug, to the right patient at the right time. We are looking for truly skillful people with hands-on ability and clear thinking. People who are ambitious that are not afraid to try out stuff and fail, motivated to make an impact and pioneer new tech and science; a scientist to lead the research and development of new AI methods and practices to drive insights from high dimensional omics data. This is a rare opportunity to lead and develop new approaches combining computational biology and advanced AI, utilizing a breadth of omics data from biobanks and clinical studies to data generated using ex-vivo platforms.
