The Role The main purpose of this post is to provide comprehensive statistical insight through interrogation of complex NHS datasets to identify trends and highlight areas of good practice as well as areas for improvement. You will use mathematical, statistical and operational research methodologies to model and analyse a wide range of NHS data. You will make recommendations based on your findings to improve existing operational and/or strategic business decisions. The role will offer the candidate the opportunity to familiarise themselves with a range of health systems and datasets, working closely with operational leads and clinical staff to inform operational processes. They will also gain experience with a variation of reporting and modelling tools. The role will involve a variety of tasks which could include:  Using data science methodologies and techniques effectively to model and analyse a range of healthcare information  Carry out complex analysis of complex patient flows using a variety of analytical methods and tools and be able to convey complex situations and analysis to a wide ranging audience  Create new predictive systems to improve forecasting and demand planning  Provide in depth analysis of performance issues, highlighting any variation and providing insight.  Assist in the development of data visualisation techniques to present analytical results  Use simulation modelling techniques for operational research work, using open source tools such as R Studio or Python  Ensure new models are regularly tested and validated to maintain accuracy  Ensure regular routine models are automated Location We are based in The Range Global Headquarters, a 10 minute walk away from the main hospital.

Initially, you should be able to attend The Range in person to ensure that you can be supported as a new starter and eventually take back home appropriate kit that will enable a successful home-workstation set-up. The Candidate We are seeking a highly motivated individual with a relevant degree (e.g. data science) who is quick and keen to learn, with a passion for using computer programming languages to perform deep-dive investigations, data analytics and modelling, providing evidence for strategic and operational decisions to benefit patient care.

They will have exceptional attention to detail, promoting high standards in all that they do and be adaptable and flexible in meeting the challenges that healthcare data science entails. You must have the ability to work independently, taking responsibility for delivery of work within agreed timescales. Whilst team working is essential, in time you will come to be expected to work independently to develop solutions and seek out answers to problems using your own initiative. Previous experience working within Data Science is an advantage, likewise for previous domain knowledge of the NHS or healthcare, but neither are essential. Desirable Skills and Experience NHS Data knowledge is unlikely, but not a barrier for a candidate with the right aptitude for learning about this domain. Technical skills include R and Python, and also Excel and reporting delivery tools such as SSRS and PowerBI Knowledge of multiple modelling techniques including discrete event simulation, machine learning, forecasting and multivariate statistics Excellent communication skills, both written and verbal, including presenting complex information to large groups of staff The scope of systems we report from is large, therefore the ability to work as a team, present issues and solutions confidently, and take on board feedback, is essential to not becoming overwhelmed. Naturally, experience in working in an organisation with similar scope and pressures would be an advantage. Likewise, the demonstrable desire to work in such an organisation and develop at an exciting pace as a Data Scientist is equally desired.

Graduate Data Scientist,Optiver,"Amsterdam, Netherlands", Optiver,"Can you solve this puzzle? An ant leaves its anthill in order to forage for food. It moves with the speed of 10cm per second, but it doesn't know where to go, therefore every second it moves randomly 10cm directly north, south, east or west with equal probability.  If the food is located on east-west lines 20cm to the north and 20cm to the south, as well as on north-south lines 20cm to the east and 20cm to the west from the anthill, how long will it take the ant to reach it on average?  What is the average time the ant will reach food if it is located only on a diagonal line passing through (10cm, 0cm) and (0cm, 10cm) points?  Can you write a program that comes up with an estimate of average time to find food for any closed boundary around the anthill? What would be the answer if food is located outside an defined by ( (x – 2.5cm) / 30cm )2 + ( (y – 2.5cm) / 40cm )2 < 1 in coordinate system where the anthill is located at (x = 0cm, y = 0cm)?
