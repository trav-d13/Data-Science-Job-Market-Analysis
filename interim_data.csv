Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global... Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. Our Client: Our client is a crypto-focused investment firm. Our client is seeking a Data Scientist to join its investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:  Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines  Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights  Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. In this role, you will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data. There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data- driven insights into concise, well written reports. We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody at our client to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self- starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision. Requirements  1-2 years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience  Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis  Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse  Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems  Excellent written communication  Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto  Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you  No unchecked egos. At our client, we all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.  Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week. If you do not meet these requirements, please do not apply. If you believe you do, please include a very short note / send a message along with your application describing your experience and skillset, with particular attention to your level of interest in crypto.
